# hello
This is the example repository for the "go" example.

Includes a simple hello world go file that uses a library as an import.

The package stringutil contains utility functions for working with strings. The first function created and used is "Reverse"
  Reverse returns its argument string reversed rune-wise left to right.

In the library a test is created which uses the Go lightweight test framework.
